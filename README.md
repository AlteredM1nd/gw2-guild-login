## Requirements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installing the plugin, you'll need:

1. A self-hosted WordPress installation (version 5.6 or higher)
2. A Guild Wars 2 account with an active API key
3. The guild ID of the guild you want to verify membership against

### Finding Your Guild ID

To find your Guild ID, you can use one of these methods:

1. **Using the Guild Search API (easiest method):**
   - Visit this URL in your browser (replace `GUILD_NAME` with your guild's exact name, with spaces as `%20`):
     ```
     https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/search?name=GUILD_NAME
     ```
   - Example for guild "Lunar Melodies":
     ```
     https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/guild/search?name=Lunar%20Melodies
     ```
   - This will return your guild's ID in the format: `["GUILD_ID_HERE"]`

2. **Using Your Account's Guilds (requires API key):**
   - Log in to your Guild Wars 2 account at [account.arena.net](https://account.arena.net/)
   - Create an API key with the `guilds` permission
   - Visit this URL in your browser (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key):
     ```
     https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account/guilds?access_token=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```
   - This will return a list of guild IDs your account has access to

2. Add a title and content for your page
3. In the Page Attributes box (usually on the right side), find the **Template** dropdown
4. Select **Guild Members Only** from the dropdown
5. Publish or Update the page

**Features:**
- Completely blocks access to non-guild members
- Automatically redirects to the login page if not logged in
- Shows an error message if the user is logged in but not a guild member
- Maintains the original URL for clean navigation

### Shortcodes

### Shortcode vs. Page Template

| Feature | Shortcode | Page Template |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Shows page to non-members | Yes | No |
| Shows page to logged-out users | Yes | No |
| Redirects non-members | No | Yes |
| Good for public pages with protected sections | âœ“ |  |
| Good for completely private pages |  | âœ“ |

#### 1. Basic Login Form

The most common way to use the plugin is with the login form shortcode:

```
[gw2_login]
```

This will display a simple login form where users can enter their GW2 API key.

#### 2. Customizing the Login Form

You can customize the login form with additional attributes:

```
[gw2_login 
    redirect="/members-only/"
    label="GW2 API Key"
    button_text="Connect with GW2"
    remember="true"
]
```

- `redirect`: URL to redirect to after successful login (default: current page)
- `label`: Custom label for the API key field
- `button_text`: Custom text for the submit button
- `remember`: Whether to show "Remember Me" checkbox (true/false)

#### 3. Protecting Content

Restrict content to logged-in guild members:

```
[gw2_guild_only]
    <h2>Welcome, Guild Member!</h2>
    <p>This content is only visible to members of our guild.</p>
    <p>You can include any HTML content here.</p>
[/gw2_guild_only]
```

#### 4. Showing Different Content to Members and Guests

```
[gw2_guild_only]
    <p>Welcome back, guild member!</p>
[gw2_guild_else]
    <p>Please log in with your GW2 API key to view this content.</p>
    [gw2_login]
[/gw2_guild_only]
```

#### 5. Login/Logout Links

Add a dynamic login/logout link:

```
[gw2_loginout]
```

Customize the text:

```
[gw2_loginout login_text="Sign In" logout_text="Sign Out"]
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Custom Redirects After Login

Set a default redirect URL in the plugin settings, or use the `redirect` parameter:

```
[gw2_login redirect="/members-area/"]
```

#### Styling the Login Form

Add this CSS to your theme's `style.css` or Customizer:

```css
/* Container */
.gw2-login-form {
    max-width: 400px;
    margin: 2em auto;
    padding: 20px;
    background: #f9f9f9;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 4px;
}

/* Input fields */
.gw2-login-form input[type="text"] {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 3px;
}

/* Submit button */
.gw2-login-form .button {
    background: #4CAF50;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 3px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

/* Error messages */
.gw2-login-error {
    color: #d32f2f;
    margin: 10px 0;
    padding: 10px;
    background: #ffebee;
    border-left: 4px solid #d32f2f;
}

/* Success messages */
.gw2-login-success {
    color: #388e3c;
    margin: 10px 0;
    padding: 10px;
    background: #e8f5e9;
    border-left: 4px solid #388e3c;
}
```

### Managing Users

#### Viewing GW2 Information

After users log in, their GW2 account information is stored in their WordPress user profile:

1. Go to **Users** in the WordPress admin
2. Click on a user to edit their profile
3. Scroll down to the "GW2 Information" section
4. You'll see their account name, guild membership status, and other details

#### Manual User Management

- To remove a user's access, simply remove their GW2 API key from their profile
- To block a user, change their WordPress role to one that doesn't have access to protected content
- To delete a user, use the standard WordPress user management tools

### API Rate Limiting

The plugin respects the Guild Wars 2 API rate limits. By default, it will:
- Cache API responses for 1 hour
- Automatically handle rate limiting
- Show appropriate error messages if the API is unavailable

You can adjust the cache duration in the plugin settings if needed.

### Getting a GW2 API Key

1. Log in to your Guild Wars 2 account at [account.arena.net](https://account.arena.net/)
2. Navigate to **Applications**
3. Click **New Key**
4. Enter a name for the key (e.g., "My WordPress Site")
5. Check the following permissions:
   - `account` - Required for basic account information
   - `guilds` - Required for guild membership verification
6. Click **Create API Key**
7. Copy the generated key and use it to log in

## Customization

### Styling

You can customize the appearance of the login form by adding CSS to your theme's `style.css` file or through the WordPress Customizer. The form uses the following CSS classes:

    /* Input fields */
}

.gw2-login-form .button {
    /* Submit button */
}
